### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Arthur. I'm anything but a developer. I just enjoy creating things. I used to be go crazy about React and 'em. Nowadays I mostly write Next.js, TypeScript, Node.js and a teeny tiny bit of Go :/
I've written [a few articles](https://lasagna.hashnode.dev/) on Hashnode and I post random tweets when I'm bored.

Currently, I'm building [my portfolio](https://github.com/ebarthur). If you have any crazy ideas that you want people aboard, just [write me an email](arthurebenezer@aol.com) or DM on [X](https://x.com/StatmanAartt)
